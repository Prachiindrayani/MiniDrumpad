# MiniDrumpad
This is my first repository! I created a mini DrumPad with html, css, javascript. 

Discription:

This a simple 3Ã—3 broad drumpad.
To add sounds I used the audio files I uploaded on Dropbox.
I animated some text to make it look better.
And That's all!


How To Run:

All the code is written in one file, so run this file in any web IDE.


End:

As I am a beginner and the project is small, I couldn't write a good README. 
Thanks for viewing README.
